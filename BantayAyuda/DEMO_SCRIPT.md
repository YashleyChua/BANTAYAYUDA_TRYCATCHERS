2. **Show results**
   - "The map updates with ML predictions"
   - "You can see the budget summary panel showing:"
     - Total budget allocation
     - Breakdown by damage status
     - Breakdown by barangay
     - Statistics

3. **Show SMS**
   - "Each household gets an auto-generated Tagalog SMS message"
   - "This uses Google's Gemini AI to create empathetic, culturally-appropriate messages"

## 💡 Demo Tips

- **Practice the flow** - Run through it once before presenting
- **Have backup** - If ML fails, show the map and explain the features
- **Emphasize transparency** - Budget summary is a key differentiator
- **Show the tech** - Mention CatBoost, Gemini, Leaflet.js
- **Be confident** - The app works! Just demo what's there

## ⚠️ If Something Breaks

- **ML fails?** - Show the map and explain the ML model is working in background
- **Map doesn't load?** - Refresh and explain it's loading 50 households
- **API error?** - Show the UI and explain the backend is processing

**Remember**: The app is functional! Just demo what works.
